# Data Analysis Steps
Mostly from Regression and ANOVA by Faraway.

## Data Collection
  - Are the data observational or experimental? Are the data a sample of convenience or were they obtained via a designed sample survey. How the data were collected has a crucial impact on what conclusions can be made.
  - Is there non-response? The data you donâ€™t see may be just as important as the data you do see.
  - Are there missing values? This is a common problem that is troublesome and time consuming to deal with.
  - How are the data coded? In particular, how are the qualitative variables represented.
  - What are the units of measurement? Sometimes data is collected or represented with far more digits than are necessary. Consider rounding if this will help with the interpretation or storage costs.
  - Beware of data entry errors. This problem is all too common - almost a certainty in any real dataset of at least moderate size. Perform some data sanity checks.

## Initial Data Analysis
  - Numerical summaries: means, sds, five-number summaries, correlations.
  - Graphical summaries
    - One variable: Boxplots, histograms etc.
    - Two variables: scatterplots.
    - Many variables: interactive graphics.
Look for outliers, data-entry errors and skewed or unusual distributions. Are the data distributed as you expect?
